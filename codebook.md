0. __Downloading the dataset__
*The Dataset was downloaded as a .zip file and extracted into a folder called `<UCI HAR Dataset>`
1. __Dataset Assignation__
* `<features>`: 561 rows, 2 columns
The “features” object from this database comes from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw data signals from phones
*`<activities>`: 6 rows, 2 columns
This object is a list of activities performed when measurements were taken. This can be thought of as a vector of target variables
*`<subtest>`: 2947 rows, 1 column
This object contains  9 (out of 30) unique volunteer test subjects

*`<xtest>`: 2947 rows, 561 columns
This object contains recorded test data for “features”.

*`<ytest>`: 2947 rows, 1 column
This object contains recorded test data for “activities”.

*`<subtrain>`: 7352 rows, 1 column
This object contains training data of 21 (out of 30) volunteers

*`<xtrain>`: 7352 rows, 561 columns
This object contains recorded training data for “features”.

*`<ytrain>`: 7352 rows, 1 column
contains training data of “activities”.

3. __Merging training and test set__
*`<X>` is generated by merging `<xtrain>` and `<xtest>`
*`<Y>` is generated by combining train and ytest
*`<Subject>` is generated by combining subtrain and subtest
*`<mgdata>` is generated by merging the 3 previous datasets: `<X,Y,Subject>`

4. __Extract mean and standard deviation for each measurement__
*`<TDat>` is generated  by subsetting mgdata with only standard deviation and mean selected for each column

5. __Use descriptive activity names__
*Code column of `<TDat>` is replaced with corresponding activity label from the `<activities>` object

6. __Label dataset with descriptive variable names__
*All variable names including `<Mag>` replaced with `<Magnitude>`
*All variable names including `<BodyBody>` replaced with `<Body>`
*All variable names including `<Gyro>` replaced with `<Gyroscope>`
*All variable names including `<Acc>` replaced with `<Accelerometer>`
*All variable names including `<^f>` replaced with `<Frequency>`
*All variable names including `<^t>` replaced with `<Time>`
*All variable names including `<tBody>` replaced with `<TimeBody>`
*All variable names including `<-mean()>` replaced with `<Mean>`
*All variable names including `<-std()>` replaced with `<STD.DEV>`
*All variable names including `<-freq()>` replaced with `<Frequency>`
*All variable names including `<angle>` replaced with `<Angle>`
*All variable names including `<gravity>` replaced with `<Gravity>`

7. __Create second dataset including mean for each activity and subject__
*`<CleanData>` is created by summarizing Data with each mean
*`<CleanData>` is exported as a file named `<CleanData.txt>`
